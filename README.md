# Healthcare Cost Barriers in the U.S.- Impact of Poverty & Insurance Coverage
Overview

This project analyzes how poverty and insurance coverage influence Americans’ ability to afford medical care. By combining the CDC’s BRFSS survey data with state-level economic indicators from the American Community Survey (ACS), the analysis identifies where financial stress most restricts access to care and which populations are most affected.

Key Findings

Cost-related barriers are highest in the South and Southwest, with Texas and Mississippi leading both uninsured and affordability rates.

Young adults (25–29) and women report the greatest financial strain.

High affordability barriers persist post-pandemic, even among insured groups, reflecting widespread underinsurance.

Poverty and uninsured rates show strong statistical relationships with the percentage of adults unable to see a doctor due to cost.
